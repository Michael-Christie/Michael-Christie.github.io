						<h2>Hosted Game Jams</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						Over the last year, I've not only participated but hosted Game Jams, as part of a society as well as personal Jams to support charities!
					</p>

							<h3>University Game Jams</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							As part of the Game Dev Society, we ran several game jams in University for students to come and participate in. We ran a varriety of jams from
							short Mini-Jams consisting of only lasting a few hours to 24 and 48 hour jams that we're hosted over the weekend. I also got the opitunity to assist
							the School of Computer Science to run Global Game Jam.
						</p>
						<p>
							I contributed alot to run these events. I helped organise the Jam, include details like the theme and modifiers, which consisted of comming together
							with the other members organising the jam, disscussing each item and voting on which theme and modifiers to choose. I also helped promote the jam, passively
							such as hanging posters around the University building, as well as actively by going into lectures and talking to other years groups.
						</p>
						<p>
							During the Game Jams, there would be a schedule so that at least one organiser would always be around during the jam to help. I would often go around
							and see what people were working on, chat to them about their idea and provide feedback about how to improve what they were working on. At the end of the
							Jam there would be time for participates to show off their submition and talk about it, and then all the organisers would get together and vote for the best
							overall game, best use of theme, best use of modifiers and other categories too.

							<h3>Chip 'N Jam</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Chip 'N Jam was a game jam that I started along with my friend Sam Stubbings, in response to the National Videogame Museum in Sheffield having money issues during the Coronavirus pandemic.
							The purpose of it was to help raise money and attention to it. To be able to achieve this goal we knew that we needed to promote the Jam well, and using some of the techniques
							that I had done for previous jams held at University just wouldn't help. Instead I focused on communicating with other societies to see if they would help promote and support
							us. Out of the 15 societies I emailed about it, around 40% replied and were willing to share the jam with their own members.
						</p>
						<p>
							This game jam ended up having 56 people who joined the jam and 23 entries. <a href="https://itch.io/jam/chip-n-jam/entries"> A full list of the submission can be seen here!</a>
							As well as this, we also managed to raise Â£320 for the National Videogame Museum.
