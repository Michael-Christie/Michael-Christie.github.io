						<h2>Discord Games</h2>
					</header>
					<p>
						When becoming the VP for the Game Dev Society, I ended up taking over the bot we had on the server. To learn how to work on this, I decided
						to try make a game that ran inside Discord.
					</p>

							<h3>Tic Tac Toe</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							Creating Tic Tac Toe to be played inside of Discord was a response to me creating chess to be played in Discord. I didn't like the fact that all
							I was really using Discord for was a way to send a message to update the chess board, rather then feeling like I was using Discord as the way to
							play the game. Discord allows messages to be reacted to, which I thought could be an interesting way to navigate through a game, and so knowing that
							there is a limited number of reactions that can be, I needed to use a game that only needed a few actions to be played, hence why I choose Tic Tac Toe
							as I only needed to show at max 9 different tiles that could be taken by the player.
						</p>
						<img width="90%" src="images/Discord/DiscordTicTac.gif" />
						<p>
							I started by breaking down the way in which I would need to get the game to work:
						<ul>
							<li>A way to start the game off</li>
							<li>Create a new room for the game to be hosted in (with permissions)</li>
							<li>A way to find out what reaction has be selected</li>
							<li>A way to update the board</li>
							<li>Checking for winning / losing conditions</li>
						</ul>
						After figuring out the way in which the system would work, I started off working on the way in which the player would start the game off, creating a
						catergory to hold the active rooms in, and creating a new text room as a child of this category to, and setting up the permissions to stop the player
						from being able to send messages in the chat.<br />
						Next I needed to work on a way to detect when a reaction was added. When I first created this, there was no specific reaction added Event that was
						called, I so I had to use the raw packets that we're sent and to check through them all to find a reaction packet, however the Discord API recently got updated
						to include a reaction added event which makes finding when a reaction is added and the channel that reaction was added into alot easier. By finding out the
						channel that the reaction was added in, I can compare that channel to all active game channels and find the corrosponding game room and pass the reaction to it,
						which that translates the emoji code into a board possition.
						</p>

						<p>
							Overall I really like the flow that is created by intergrating playing a game through the reactions that Discord allows us to do, and nothing about the way
							in which you play the game feels off. There is obviously limitations to what types of games could be played through because of the amount of reactions that can
							be placed on a message, however you could easily create a small room based game, with a couple simple interactions like moving around and an interact button.
